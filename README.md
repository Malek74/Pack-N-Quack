# Pack-N-Quack
Pack N Quack is an innovative solution that empowers travelers to create unforgettable experiences, discover local gems, and plan every detail of their trips with ease. With a user-friendly interface and a comprehensive suite of features, the app allows adventurers to personalize their itineraries, book accommodations and transport, and explore curated activities, all within a single, seamless platform. Designed for everyone—from solo travelers to families—our app brings the world to your fingertips, making travel planning both enjoyable and stress-free.

## Motivation

In today's rapidly evolving travel landscape, tourists seek seamless and personalized experiences that cater to their diverse needs and preferences. However, existing platforms often fall short in providing a comprehensive, user-centric solution that bridges the gap between various stakeholders in the tourism industry. This is where **Pack-N-Quack** comes into play.

### Identifying the Gaps

1. **Fragmented Services**:
   - **Issue**: Travelers frequently navigate multiple websites and applications to book flights, accommodations, activities, and transportation, leading to a disjointed and time-consuming planning process.
   - **Solution**: Pack-N-Quack consolidates all essential travel services into a single, unified platform, offering a one-stop solution for all booking needs.

2. **Lack of Personalization**:
   - **Issue**: Many tourism platforms offer generic recommendations, failing to tailor experiences based on individual preferences, interests, and special occasions.
   - **Solution**: By leveraging user roles and personalized data, Pack-N-Quack provides customized itineraries, activities, and promotions, enhancing the overall travel experience.

3. **Inefficient Communication**:
   - **Issue**: Real-time updates and notifications are often missing, leaving users uninformed about important changes, confirmations, and opportunities.
   - **Solution**: Pack-N-Quack integrates real-time notifications, ensuring users stay informed and engaged throughout their journey.

4. **Limited Marketplace Integration**:
   - **Issue**: Tourists and local sellers have limited avenues to interact, buy, and sell tourism-related goods, restricting the economic potential of the tourism ecosystem.
   - **Solution**: Our integrated marketplace fosters direct interactions between tourists and sellers, promoting local businesses and offering travelers unique products tailored to their needs.

## Installation and How to use?

To set up the project and install all dependencies, run the following command in the root directory:


```
npm run install:all
```
If you encounter errors, you can install the modules for the frontend and backend separately:
### Install frontend dependencies
```cd client
npm install
```

### Install backend dependencies
```
cd ../server
npm install
```

To start the project in development mode, open two separate terminals:

### First Terminal
```
cd client
npm run dev
```
### Second Terminal
```
cd ../server
npm run dev
```

**The frontend and backend should now be running concurrently in development mode.**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
