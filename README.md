## Installation

To set up the project and install all dependencies, run the following command in the root directory:


`npm run install:all`

If you encounter errors, you can install the modules for the frontend and backend separately:
### Install frontend dependencies
`cd client
npm install`

### Install backend dependencies
`cd ../server
npm install`

To start the project in development mode, open two separate terminals:

### First Terminal
`cd client
npm run dev
`
### Second Terminal
`cd ../server
npm run dev`

**The frontend and backend should now be running concurrently in development mode.
